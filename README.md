# Edication Repository

This is a shared repository between students of first group of *Futuro Camp*

# Usage

Every student from first group is required to create a new branch every time he/she is doing a new course project.
After you finish your project, or if review stage is requested by managers, you need to create a new PR to the branch named with your full name.

# Technical stack

  * Git client - use any client which fits your needs, it could be either *git-cli* or *GitKraken*.

  * All another software stack is project-dependant.
